In case you don&apos;t want to generate media queries, which is default Visage behaviour, but you need to render website correctly for the user&apos;s device, you need to implement device detection on the server.

Then based on the device, you need to set up `is` prop on `DesignSystem` component to say what is the current breakpoint. Also you&apos;ll need to send this information in HTML so React hydration will work correctly.

Following example uses [node-device-detector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-device-detector) with fallback to mobile detection.
