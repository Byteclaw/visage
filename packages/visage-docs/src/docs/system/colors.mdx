# Colors

Efficient language for colors can be established by a color palette. A designer just gives every color in a design a name.

> Designer: Here is a new secondary button. It uses `secondary` background color and `secondaryText` font color.
> Mentioned colors are new in your color palette. Set the `secondary` to `#999` and `secondaryText` to `#fff`.

> Developer: OK, thanks.

For the developer this translates to:

```js transpile=false
{
  secondary: '#999',
  secondaryText: '#fff',
}
```

Conversation above is efficient because we just needed names and hex codes to introduce new colors to the system and use them. Another benefit is that we can easily change the color application wide.

Lets imagine another scenario. Many designs use a specific color with different shades and tints. How can a designer communicate that easily with a developer?

> Designer: Please use as a border color for secondary button a second shade of secondary color and on hover change background color to first tint of secondary color.

> Developer: OK, but the secondary color does not have any tints or shades.

> Designer: Oh, you're right. Please use the following scale for secondary color. There are 2 tints #aaa and #bbb where #bbb is the lightest so use it as second and #888, #777 are shades. Please use #777 as second shade.

> Developer: OK, I'll change it. The base is #999.

This conversation translates to a change in color palette where the developer changes secondary color to a scale.

```js transpile=false
{
  secondary: {
    values: ['#bbb', '#aaa', '#999', '#888', '#777'],
    offset: 2,
  }
}
```

And the styles of a button will look like this:

```js transpile=false
{
  backgroundColor: 'secondary',
  color: 'secondaryText',
  borderColor: 'secondary.2',
  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: 'secondary.-2'
  }
}
```

[Scale](/system/scales) is a special representation of possible values which can be addressed using `steps` which are positive or negative integers. In above example shades are refered using positive numbers and tints using opposite, base can be refered without a number or step can be set to `0` (e.g. `secondary.0`).
