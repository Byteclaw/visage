# Spacings

Spacings (`margin`, `padding`) can be described in absolute or relative units. But that way a whole design can easily end up in a mess where every design element uses different spacings.

This can be fixed by some sort of a spacing "palette" where you have a name for any spacing used in the application. Eventually even this can become a mess where every spacing is random. Then if some spacing is changed it can cause the application design look really weird.

Better solution would be to use some base spacing that is systematically used in the whole application. For example we can use N-point spacing system where the base spacing is `8px` and we use just multiplies of this number in whole design. This way if we change the base, the design with change systematically in a consistent way.

> Designer: Above mentioned secondary button has margin right of 1 unit and padding of 2 units.

> Developer: OK, thanks.

## N-point grid system

Visage offers a `createNPointFontScale` and `createNPointModularScale` themes from `@byteclaw/visage-themes` package. Bot themes use N-point grid system where the spacing are computed as multiplies of `baseGridSize`.

A theme created by one of the above mentioned ways is using N-point grid system under the hood for all `margin` and `padding` properties. So the designer can just say that the base spacing is `8px` and then communicate in multiplies.

For example if designer says that the right margin should be 2 units, the developer can specify `margin-right: 2` or `mr: 2`.
