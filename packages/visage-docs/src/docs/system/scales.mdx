# Scales

Scales are a special type of value that can contain more than one value and every value can be addressed using positive or negative integers.

Scales are mostly used to define a color and it's tints/shades or font sizes and corresponding line heights.

## Usage in color palette

A designer can specify different tints and shades for a color and then address them in communication.

> Designer: Use second shade of secondary color.

Which a developer translates to `secondary.2`.

> Designer: Use second tint of secondary color.

Which the developer translates to opposite `secondary.-2`.

If no shade or tint is mentioned, then the base color is used which is translated to `secondary` for the developer.

## Usage in typography

A designer can specify font sizes or line heights as scales too. For example an application can have 2 font sizes with corrensponding line heigts for small text and then 5 bigger font sizes in addition to base font size.

> Designer: We will have 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24px font sizes with a base set to 14px.

Which the developer translates to a scale where `offset` is an index of `14px`.

> Designer: For each font size we want a line height as 4px added to a font size in a scale.

The developer will translate the above mentioned information to another scale which has same `offset` and values are the values from font size scale where each value has `4px` added.

For the developer it will look like this:

```js transpile=false
{
  fontSize: {
    values: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24],
    offset: 2,
  },
  lineHeight: {
    values: [14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28],
    offset: 2,
  },
}
```

## Internal representation

For the developer the scale is an object with `values` array which contains more than one value and `offset` property which says on what index base value is defined.

```js transpile=false
{
  values: ['-2', '-1', '0', '1', '2'],
  offset: 2,
}
```

Lets say the above scale is defined under the name `scale`. If we want to get the value `-2` we must use `scale.-2`, if we want the value '2' we must use `scale.2`. If we want to access base value we can use `scale` or `scale.0`.

## Out of bounds value access

If you access a value out of bounds then the last value in a given direction is used. For example `scale.-3` will return `-2`.
