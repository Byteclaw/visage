# Typography

The communication about typography can be really hard. There are fonts, font sizes, line heights. How can we easily communicate that? How can we keep it consistent?

We can specify a palette of font families. For example you can use one font family for non-heading elements as `body` and different font family for headings as `heading` font family.

> Designer: Secondary button uses `body` font family.

> Developer: OK, thanks.

Now we just need to somehow keep the font sizes and line heights consistent. A designer can specify font sizes as a [scale](/system/scales) (for example `12, 14, 16, 20px`) with a [scale](/system/scales) of corrensponding line heights (for example `16, 28, 20, 24px`).

> Designer: Secondary button has font size 2 and line height 2.

> Developer: OK, thanks.

The designer just said that Secondary button uses font size of `14px` and line height of `18px` but the developer doesn't care about that because it's specified in a system.

Or the designer can leverage some existing typographic system for example [Modular Scale](https://www.modularscale.com). For this purpose Visage has it's own theme `createNPointModularScaleTheme` from `@byteclaw/visage-themes` package.
