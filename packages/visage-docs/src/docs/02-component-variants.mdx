Often there is a need in an application to use the same component but with different looking. An examples of such variants can be button of large size or a button which is disabled.

This can be achieved using style object.

But you can end up in a scenario when React will complain that the given prop is not known to a HTML element (because Visage components do not omit the props automatically).

In this case you should use our variant creators, which work as a syntactic sugar.

## Boolean variants

Boolean variants can be used by `booleanVariant()` function. This function accepts a name of prop used to control the style, boolean flag whether the prop should be ommitted from the HTML element and an optional default value, which is set to `false` by default.

This functions has it&apos;s `booleanVariantStyles()` function, that helps you to generate correct style object, so it matches the value correctly.

The same can be achieved manually without `booleanVariantStyles()`.

## Enum variants

There are cases when the variant of a component can&apos;t be described using a boolean flag. For example button can have different sizes.

For this scenario we have `variant()` function. This function accepts a name of prop used to control the style, boolean flag whether the prop should be ommitted from the HTML element, an array of possible values + `default` value and an optional default value, which is by default set to `default`.

Similar to `booleanVariant()`, `variant()` has it&apos;s own function `variantStyles()` that suits a need to generate correct style object for your variant.

<Message status="info">
  Every variant created using this function contain a default variant which
  can&apos;t be removed.

To use this correctly in Typescript you must modify your code a little so Typescript is able to resolve possible variants.

## Number prop

Sometime it happens that you need to work with some number value in your styles (for example `zIndex`). But you don&apos;t want to create a completely custom component just for that.

In this case you can use `numberProp()` variant creator which accepts a name of prop used to control style, boolean flag whether the prop should be ommitted from the HTML element and an optional default value, which doesn&apos;t have any value.

`numberProp()` doesn&apos;t have a styling function so you need to use style function on your component.
