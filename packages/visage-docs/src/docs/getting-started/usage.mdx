# Usage

**Each React application that wants to use Visage components and leverage the design system, needs to wrap application in `DesignSystem` or `ResponsiveDesignSystem` component.**

### Non Responsive Applications

In order to start with Non Responsive Application you need to import [DesignSystem](./components/design-system) component and pass it a theme instance.
You can start with a simple default theme and gradually create your own settings. This component doesn't provide any breakpoint detection.

```jsx transpile=false
import { DesignSystem, Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';
import { createDocsTheme } from '@byteclaw/visage-themes';

const theme = createDocsTheme();

<DesignSystem theme={theme}>
  <Text>Hello world!</Text>
</DesignSystem>;
```

  Non Responsive Applications can be easily turned to Responsive by replacing
  `DesignSystem` with `ResponsiveDesignSystem`.

### Responsive Applications

As was already mentioned, in order to use Visage for responsive application you need to import [ResponsiveDesignSystem](./components/responsive-design-system) component. Under the hood, this component uses [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) API to match breakpoints and set up a current device breakpoint.
You don't need to worry about that, to start implementing responsive styles and behaviour. To make styles adjust to the device size, just define the specific style value as array[] where array item index matches the index of device. If you specify less values than there are devices, the last value will be used for additional bigger devices.

This text component will have zero horizontal padding on mobile devices, but two units of horizontal padding on any screen bigger than mobile phone.

```jsx transpile=false
import { ResponsiveDesignSystem, Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';
import { createDocsTheme } from '@byteclaw/visage-themes';

const theme = createDocsTheme();

<ResponsiveDesignSystem theme={theme}>
  <Text styles={{ px: [0, 2] }}>Hello world!</Text>
</ResponsiveDesignSystem>;
```

  If don't want to use <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia" target="noopener noreferrer">window.matchMedia API</Link>, you can set up Visage to generate media queries. Only problem with that approach is that <Link href="/components/responsive-utils/is-breakpoint">IsBreakpoint</Link> component won't work.
