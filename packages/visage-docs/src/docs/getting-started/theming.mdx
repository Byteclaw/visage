# Theming

**Theme is the single most important API exposed to you for keeping Visage components in line with rules of your design.**

By default, Visage uses a font-based `scale` theme. It means that the typography and other settings are defined as a scale, indexed from 0. The scale
is just an object with array of values and optional offset.

```js transpile=false
{
    values: [10, 12, 16, 20, 28, 38],
    offset: 1,
}
```

In case of `fontSize`, the values could be just pixel sizes. The `offset: 1` defines that the base font (in other words the 0 index) is moved
by 1 to the right. So in this example, `12` would be the base font size.

Each theme setting is either a scale object or simple scalar value (like string or number). All the scale values can be replaced by a simple value.
But scales give you much more power in defining styles on your components.

## Theme settings

You can use theme to define properties of the design system.
