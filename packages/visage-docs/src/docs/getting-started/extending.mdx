# Extending

**You can extend Visage by changing component visuals or create completely new components. In this section, we will cover these
options and draw the basic principles. The more in-depth approaches will be covered in next chapters.**

## Changing the look and feel

Visage comes with a default theme and set of components, which cover most basic use-cases. This is great for rapid prototyping of React apps,
but in a real-world production scenario, you almost always need your own components tailored for certain design. For this, you can leverage two levels
of customizing the looks and feels of the library: `styles` and `theme`.

### Styling

Visage uses CSS object styles as the source of styles for components with addition to something called [responsive CSS properties](#responsive-css-properties).
CSS object styles are just simple object literals passed to a Visage component. Under the hood, Visage will merge and cache the styles you provide, with default 
settings of the component and generate a proper css classname. This way, a classname is generated only when needed to optimize the performance.

```jsx transpile=false
import { Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';

  <Text styles={{
      color: 'red',
      fontSize: 1,
      fontWeight: 600,
  }}>Hello world!</Text>;
```

More complex components may expose different other props and let you customize styles of internal parts, but nearly all Visage components
can be customized by passing your own style object. 

You can also use pseudo-classes and complex selectors, when defining styles. It may seem like getting back to writing a good ol' CSS, but
you have the power of responsive styles, theme and caching in your pocket, so you only define the styles on the component and Visage takes care of
everything else.

```jsx transpile=false
import { Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';

  <Text styles={{
      fontSize: 1,
      fontWeight: 600,
      '&:hover': {
        color: 'red',
      }
  }}>Hello world!</Text>;
```

### Theme

To leverage a full potential of a design system, there have to be some existing language defined between designer and developer. In our case, it is
achieved via theme, that harbours all the rules defined in a design language. This all may sound too abstract, but theme is really just a couple of
settings telling Visage components how to compute their values. For example, it may define font sizes, color palette and unit of spacing. This way,
it should be clear what is meant by `red` when designer says that danger button uses a red color or what happens, when you set font size as level `3`.

Different themes can have different ways of scaling units or using colors. The default theme comes with a pre-existing color palette, spacing 
and typography settings. 

```jsx transpile=false
import { DesignSystem, Button } from '@byteclaw/visage';
import { createDocsTheme } from '@byteclaw/visage-themes';

const theme = createDocsTheme();

<DesignSystem theme={theme}>
  <Button styles={{ backgroundColor: 'primary' }}>Click me!</Button>
</DesignSystem>;
```

The theme is an object with certain expected shape and it gives you several options how to define things. You can override existing 
theme settings, or create completely new theme. 

The first scenario is easy and when using `Typescript` you even get type hints on how should the settings look like. We will discuss 
each theme setting in next chapters.

```jsx transpile=false
import { DesignSystem, Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';
import { createDocsTheme } from '@byteclaw/visage-themes';

const theme = createDocsTheme({
    baseGridSize: 4,
    colors: {
        nightPurple: 'rgb(138,30,233)'
    },
});

<DesignSystem theme={theme}>
  <Button styles={{ backgroundColor: 'nightPurple' }}>Click me!</Button>
</DesignSystem>;
```

## Composing

Besides extending styles of existing components, you'll probably want to create new component which utilize Visage design system.
One of the ways is simply by creating a component composed of Visage components and perhaps passing props down the tree.

### With existing components

```jsx transpile=false
import { DesignSystem, Text } from '@byteclaw/visage';

const PaginationBar = ({ currentPage, nextPageHandler, prevPageHandler, styles }) => (
  <Pagination styles={styles}>
    <PreviousPageButton onClick={prevPageHandler} />
    <Text>{currentPage}</Text>
    <NextPageButton onClick={nextPageHandler} />
  </Pagination>
)

```

### Creating Visage component

Sometimes you need something with a specific styling and behaviour and you cannot really achieve it with the components 
the UI library provides you. All the provided components are created as `Visage components`, which means they obey rules of the
system and have access to theme settings. To create such component, you just need to call visage function `createComponent` and 
provide it a short list of parameters.

Let's create a simple obedient component from scratch.

```jsx transpile=false
import { createComponent } from '@byteclaw/visage-core';

export const Circle = createComponent('div', {
  displayName: 'Circle',
  defaultProps: {
    // any default props go here
  },
  defaultStyles: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    borderRadius: '50%',
    display: 'inline-block',
    verticalAlign: 'top',
    overflow: 'hidden',
    textTransform: 'uppercase',
    m: 0,
    lineHeight: '2em',
    height: '2em',
    width: '2em',
  },
});

```

As you can see, it works similar to function like `styled` from styled-components or emotion. In fact, we use Emotion class generator
on the background, but we add our own theming, cache and formatting. First parameter is always the base component or `HTML tag`.
Based on this, Visage figures out, how to merge the styles you provided. You can pass any valid `html tag`, `React component` or another
`Visage component`. The system will look at it, and decide what to do. We force user to define at least `displayName`, so we can provide him
with some additional theming functionality that we'll cover later, but it also makes for a better debugging experience. 
Other parameters (`defaultProps`, `defaultStyles` and `variants`) are fully optional and we will cover them in next chapters.

With `createComponent`, you can achieve a lot more, like add style [variants](/system/variants) to your components, to enable user
express sentiment like `danger` or `success`, make different sizes or visuals.
