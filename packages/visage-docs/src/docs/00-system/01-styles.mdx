---

Styles in Visage are defined by simple objects of CSS attributes to their respective values. If you are familiar with CSS-in-JS solutions like [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) they allow you to define styles as objects, see [emotion and their object styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles) or [styled-component and their style objects](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects).

## Responsive styles

Visage supports two ways of writing responsive styles which can be combined.

### Responsive CSS attributes

Visage supports a concept of responsive CSS attributes where each CSS attribute can be written as an array. Each item in array has it&apos;s corrensponding breakpoint so you can target multiple devices in just one line from smallest to largest one.

If you want to omit (turn off) a value on some device, use `null` as a value.

You can also repeat a value from previous breakpoint by setting it to `undefined`.

<Message status="warning">
  <span>
    If you set up first value as <Code>undefined</Code> it will be the same
    meaning as if you were using <Code>null</Code>.
  </span>
</Message>

In case you used less values than breakpoints available to your application a last matched value is used.

### Media queries

Media queries are also supported. You can use jsut media queries or combine them with responsive CSS attributes too.
