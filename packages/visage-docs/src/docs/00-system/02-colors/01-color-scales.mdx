Sometimes you can find yourself in a situation when you need one particular color and it&apos;s different tones. For example you can have different tones of success color.

<ColorScale color="success" />

Each shade can be addressed by dot notation where the name of color in your palette is first followed by `.` and a number that says which tone and in which direction from offset you want to use. For example `success` and `success.0` are the same color, `success.-1` is one tone lighter and `success.1` is one tone darker.

<ColorPlayground color="success.0" />
