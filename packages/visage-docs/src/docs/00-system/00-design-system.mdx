`DesignSystem` component serves as a root component for your application that gives access to all components to the current theme and breakpoint.

Every application must be wrapped in by `DesignSystem` in order to use Visage components.

```tsx transpile=false
import { DesignSystem } from '@byteclaw/visage';
import App from './your-app';

<DesignSystem>
  <App />
</DesignSystem>;
```

## Responsive design

Design of applications is often responsive so it adapts to user&apos;s device screen size. Visage supports responsive design but you have to enable it because it&apos;s disabled by default.

To enable responsive support you need to use `responsive` prop on `DesignSystem` component. This prop enables breakpoint detection using [`window.matchMedia` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia).

Visage uses it&apos;s default set of breakpoints which can be changed.

<BreakpointsTable />

If default breakpoints don&apos;t suit your needs you change them using `breakpoints` prop.

```tsx transpile=false
<DesignSystem breakpoints={['(max-width: 100px)', '(min-width: 101px) and (max-width: 200px)', '(min-width: 201px)']}>
  <App />
</DesignSytem>
```

  Be careful when setting up custom breakpoints. Always write just a condition
  and not the whole media query.
</Banner>

By default Visage uses [`createEmotionStyleGenerator()`](/advanced-usage/emotion-style-generator) that produces only styles for current matched breakpoint and doesn&apos;t output any media queries.

Default style generator works fine for client side only applications or if you use [server side rendering with device detection](/guides/server-side-rendered-applications/render-on-server-with-device-detection).

In case you need to produce styles for server side rendered application without an ability to detect device, you need to use [`createEmotionResponsiveStyleGenerator()`](/advanced-usage/emotion-responsive-style-generator) so styles produced by Visage will contain media queries. For example you&apos;d use this in a website powered by [Gatsby](/guides/gatsby).
