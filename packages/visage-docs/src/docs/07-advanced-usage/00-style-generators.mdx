Style generator is a function produces final style representation based on an array of style objects ordered from lowest to highest priority and a context.

By final style representation we mean CSS by default, but Visage can be used to create design systems for React native too.

Visage contains 2 style generators [`createEmotionStyleGenerator()`](/advanced-usage/emotion-style-generator) that is default and [`createResponsiveEmotionStyleGenerator()`](/advanced-usage/emotion-responsive-style-generator)
