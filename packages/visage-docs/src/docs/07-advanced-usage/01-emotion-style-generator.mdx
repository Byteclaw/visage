Visage uses emotion style generator by default. It&apos;s created by `createEmotionStyleGenerator()`.

This style generator doesn&apos;t produce CSS media queries but uses the current breakpoint matched by `window.matchMedia` API.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=emotion-style-generator-o11fd
const styleGenerator = createEmotionStyleGenerator();

render(
  <DesignSystem responsive styleGenerator={styleGenerator}>
    <Text>Hello</Text>
  </DesignSystem>,
);
```

<Message status="warning">
  This style generator is not recommended for application where you cannot
  detect device on during the server side rendering.
