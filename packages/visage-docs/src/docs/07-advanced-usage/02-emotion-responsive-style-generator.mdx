In applications where you can&apos;t use device detection during server side rendering or you just need media queries in your application, you can use `createResponsiveEmotionStyleGenerator()` as your style generator.

This style generator produces a CSS with media queries for your style objects.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=emotion-responsive-style-generator-cwh2l
const styleGenerator = createResponsiveEmotionStyleGenerator(
  defaultBreakpoints,
);

render(
  <DesignSystem
    breakpoint={defaultBreakpoints}
    // use this for IsBreakpoint component to work
    responsive
    styleGenerator={styleGenerator}
  >
    <Text>Hello</Text>
  </DesignSystem>,
);
```

  It&apos;s recommended to use this style generator in static websites produced
  by systems like Gatsby.
