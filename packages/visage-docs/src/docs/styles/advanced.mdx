# Advanced styling

#### Turn off CSS property

If you pass `null` as a value of CSS property then it's ignored and doesn't produce any style.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: null, // font size is ignored
}
```

#### Turn off css property for given device

If you pass `null` as a value of responsive CSS property then it's ignored and doesn't produce any style.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: ['12px', null, '16px'], // font size is ignored on tablet
}
```

#### Inherit value from previous breakpoint

If you want to avoid repetition in responsive CSS properties and take the value from previous breakpoint, use `undefined` in place of a value.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: ['12px', undefined, '16px'], // is the same as ['12px', '12px', '16px']
}
```

⚠️ Don't use `undefined` as first value in an array because it'll turn off the property for mobile.
