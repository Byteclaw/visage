Let&apos;s say you have an application and you want to change all the buttons that use [`Button`](/components/button) component. For this use case there is a concept of [`faces`](/reusing-styles/faces).

Each Visage component created by `createComponent()` can be changed by a face that is named by this component.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=globally-extending-visage-components-tpk90
const theme = createNPointFontScaleTheme({
  ...defaultTheme.theme,
  faces: {
    Text: {
      fontSize: 2,
      lineHeight: 2,
      color: 'danger',
    },
  },
});

render(
  <DesignSystem responsive theme={theme}>
    <Text>Hello</Text>
  </DesignSystem>,
);
```

Faces are applied at the end with second highest priority after [`styles` prop](/extending-components/styles-prop).
