Let&apos;s say you have an application and you want to change all the buttons that use [`Button`](/components/button) component. For this use case there is a concept of [`faces`](/reusing-styles/faces).

Each Visage component created by `createComponent()` can be changed by a face that is named by this component.

Faces are applied at the end with second highest priority after [`styles` prop](/extending-components/styles-prop).
