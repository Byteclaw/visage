title: 'as prop'
---

`as` prop can be used to change rendered component but applies existing styles on it. That means you can have a `<button />` but you can render it as a `<a />` that looks like the button.

Styles from `Button` are merged to styles of `Link` so `Link` looks like `Button` but behaves as `Link`.
