description: 'Styling Visage components using styles prop'
---

Visage supports multiple ways of styling already created components that were created by `createComponent()`. This sections is about `styles` prop.

```tsx expanded live codesandbox=styles-prop-jkkuj
<Box styles={{ color: 'primary' }}>This is my component</Box>
```

This prop has highest priority and is merged to final style object at the end so the resulting style object will have any shared attribute overridden by the `styles` prop.

```tsx expanded live noInline codesandbox=styles-prop-jkw9t
const MyBox = createComponent('div', {
  styles: {
    color: 'primary',
  },
});

render(<MyBox styles={{ color: 'danger' }}>This is my component</MyBox>);
```

    It isn&apos;t recommended to use this way of styling because it can cause
    performance problems. You can fix them by defining styles out of component
    scope or by using <Code>@byteclaw/babel-plugin-visage</Code>
