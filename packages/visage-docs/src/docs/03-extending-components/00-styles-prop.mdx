description: 'Styling Visage components using styles prop'
---

Visage supports multiple ways of styling already created components that were created by `createComponent()`. This sections is about `styles` prop.

https://codesandbox.io/s/styles-prop-jkkuj?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js&theme=light

This prop has highest priority and is merged to final style object at the end so the resulting style object will have any shared attribute overridden by the `styles` prop.

    It isn&apos;t recommended to use this way of styling because it can cause
    performance problems. You can fix them by defining styles out of component
    scope or by using <Code>@byteclaw/babel-plugin-visage</Code>
