Visage applies styles on components using props that are produced by [style generators](/advanced-usage/style-generators).

Given this fact it&apos;s possible to turn any component to Visage component by wrapping it in `createComponent()` and passing the given props to underlying element.

In the example above we know that defaut Visage style generator produces `className` prop, so we must pass to whatever element we want to style.
