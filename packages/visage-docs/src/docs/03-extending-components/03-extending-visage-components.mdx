Each component created by `createComponent()` can be extended by wrapping it by `createComponent()`. It&apos;s basically the same approach as [`as` prop](/extending-components/as-prop) but you can easily use the component on different places.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=extending-visage-component-7f377
const RedButton = createComponent(Button, {
  styles: {
    color: 'red',
  },
});

render(<RedButton>Red text button</RedButton>);
```
