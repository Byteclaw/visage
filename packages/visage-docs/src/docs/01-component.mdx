Visage already contains a big set of predefined components that are ready to use in your application. But sometimes you can find yourself in a situation when you need some specific component that is not provided by Visage.

In this scenario you can create your own components using `createComponent()` function which serves this need.

Styles in a component created by `createComponent()` can be defined as a style object or as a function that accepts component props and returns the style object.

  We highly recommend not to use functions to style your components. If
  it&apos;s possible, try to use variants.
