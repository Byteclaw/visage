Visage already contains a big set of predefined components that are ready to use in your application. But sometimes you can find yourself in a situation when you need some specific component that is not provided by Visage.

In this scenario you can create your own components using `createComponent()` function which serves this need.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=custom-visage-component-k4c03
const MyComponent = createComponent('div', {
  displayName: 'MyComponent',
  styles: {
    color: 'primary',
    fontSize: 1,
    lineHeight: 1,
  },
});

render(<MyComponent>My component</MyComponent>);
```

Styles in a component created by `createComponent()` can be defined as a style object or as a function that accepts component props and returns the style object.

```tsx live noInline expanded codesandbox=custom-visage-component-with-styles-as-function-53gxv
const MyComponent = createComponent('div', {
  displayName: 'MyComponent',
  styles: () => ({
    color: 'primary',
    fontSize: 1,
    lineHeight: 1,
  }),
});

render(<MyComponent>My component</MyComponent>);
```

<Message status="warning">
  We highly recommend not to use functions to style your components. If
  it&apos;s possible, try to use variants.
