# Accordion

**A component that acts as a vertically stacked set of headings that can be expanded to reveal a content.**

Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when content with multiple sections is displayed on a single page.

## Examples

### Default

```jsx live=true
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Section 1">
    <Text>Section 1 content</Text>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Section 2">
    <Text>Section 2 content</Text>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Section 3">
    <Text>Section 3 content</Text>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Section 4">
    <Text>Section 4 content</Text>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```
