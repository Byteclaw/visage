# DesignSystem

Every application that wants to use Visage as it's design system must be wrapped in DesignSystem component.

DesignSystem also provides a [LayerManager](/components/layer-manager) for zIndex management and [ToastManager](/components/toast-manager) for [Toast](/components/feedback/toast) components.

## Import

```js transpile=false
import { DesignSystem } from '@byteclaw/visage';
```

## Usage

```js transpile=false
<ResponsiveDesignSystem theme={theme}>
  <Heading>Hello world</Heading>
<ResponsiveDesignSystem>
```

### Optional

#### defaultZIndex

- **number**
- **default: 100**
