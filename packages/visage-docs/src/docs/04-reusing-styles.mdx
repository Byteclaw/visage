Based on how Visage styling works. You can create shared style objects and import them to different components.

But this way it&apos;s lot of manual work with imports. There is a simpler way to do this by using `extends` and `face` CSS attributes.

## Extends

Extends is a Visage CSS attribute that can replace itself with a style object defined in your theme using `mixins` object.

By using `extends` you can create shared base style that can be extended by different components, meaning that styles of a component are merged to a style object defined in `extends`.

## Faces

Faces work in a similar way as `extends` but the styles are applied to the component at the end so you can override the styles on a component by faces. Faces are defined on theme using `faces` object.
